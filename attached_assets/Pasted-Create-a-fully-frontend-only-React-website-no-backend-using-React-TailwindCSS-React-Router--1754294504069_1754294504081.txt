Create a fully frontend-only React website (no backend) using **React + TailwindCSS + React Router**, following the requirements below:

---

📛 **Website Title:**  
"St. Martin’s GeeksforGeeks Campus Body"

---

📁 **Tech Stack:**
- React (latest version)
- TailwindCSS
- React Router DOM (`react-router-dom`)
- Google Fonts: Outfit / Poppins / Space Grotesk (clean, modern fonts)
- No external UI libraries (no Bootstrap/Material UI)
- Responsive design: mobile & desktop
- No backend — static frontend only

---

🎨 **Strict Color Palette (use only these):**
- `#3ab284` – Ocean Green (primary)
- `#00895e` – GFG Green (accent)
- `#d5f6e4` – Light Mint (subtle accents only)
- `#265645` – Deep Green (mid-background)
- `#0e201b` – Near Black (footer + bottom)
- `#ffffff` – Glowing white text

---

🧑‍💻 **Design Style:**
- All text must be `#ffffff` with **neon glow** using Tailwind (`text-shadow`, `drop-shadow`, `glow`)
- Smooth vertical gradient transitions as user scrolls (`from` → `to`)
- Rounded edges, soft shadows, glow hover effects
- Dark mode only — no white backgrounds or partitions

---

📄 **Pages (with routing):**
1. `/` – Home

3. `/resources` – Resources

---
